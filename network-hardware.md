#  Network Hardware

The only important content is probably [here](#types-of-networks) and [here](#securing-the-network).

##  Types of Networks
*  PAN
*  LAN
*  CAN
*  MAN
*  WAN
*  GAN

## Connection Methods
*  Ethernet
*  Wireless
   *  Can includes non-commercial solutions (USB/Firewire Netowrks, HomePNA or Powerline networks)
*  Older Networking technologies
   *  ARCNet
   *  Token Ring

## Network Topology
> Physical and logical

*This is presented with no context in the notes*
*  Bus networks
*  Star networks
*  Ring networks
*  Mesh networks
*  Star-bus networks
*  Tree or Hierarchical topology netowrks.

## Network Devices
*Again just a list completely without context*
*  Network Interface Card (NIC)
*  Repeater
*  Hubs
*  Bridges
*  Switches
*  Routers
*  Modems
*  Gateways
*  Firewalls
   * Personal
   * Dedicated
   * Part of edge device
* VPN Appliances
* Proxy Servers

## Computer Based Solutions For Networking
*More lists of meaningless things ahead*
*  Smoothwall, IPCop, DIY Systems
*  NICs can create bridges.
*  Network monitoring devices - Nagios

## Activities
* Intrusion Detection Systems
* VPN Access
* Firewall Rules
  * Wan, LAN and DMZ isolation
    * Smoothwall: Red, Green and Orange Zones.
  * IP Blocking
  * Port forwarding

## Securing the Network
* Don't leave the front door open.
* Training
* Physical Security
* Delineation
* Access Control
* Encryption
* Redundancy
* Maintain updates
* Periodic Audit
* Security through Obscurity
* Monitoring
  * Alarms, Trends
* Scanning
  * Network Devices
  * Servers
  * Workstations
* Default config should be locked down
  *  Allow access only as needed.
