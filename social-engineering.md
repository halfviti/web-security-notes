# Social Engineering
Social engineering is people being a bunch of meanies.

Examples:

* Car Repair shops saying you need more repairs than you do,
* Apple store doing much the same thing.
* Phishing (getting vulnerable people to give you money)
  * Nigerian 419 scam
  * We broke into your webcam and taped you watching porn so send us money.

## Phone Scams

* CRA Fraud: You owe us tax money. Please give us itunes gift cards.
* Timeshares
* Windows Tech Support scams.

## Social Media

* False business info on google maps. Either impersonating business or driving business away from said business.
* Fake reviews.
* Catfishing

## Emergency Services
* Pulling fire alarm
* Swatting
* Falsely reporting bad driving to the police

## Retail POS
* Easy point of attack

## Tainted XCode in China
* 4000 apps infected with `XCodeGhost` malware.
    > Tainted version of xcode was propogated because it could be downloaded faster from a Chinese Server. Malware was compiled into source so it was difficult to detect.

Case in point make sure you vet the libraries you use. Especially if they are compiled or non-open source.

## Mitigation

* Hide yourself, hide yo' wives, hide yo' kids.
* Don't use your full legal name.
* Don't use your real birthday.
Don't give out your SIN basically ever.
* Don't upload pictures of yourself alongside your name.
* Have multiple online identities.
* Google yourself to see how much info is available.

## Types of Attack

### The Mysterious USB
Beware lone USBs sitting outside alone. If you must plug them in do it on an airgapped machine that you are ok being compromised.

### The Official Looking Wanderer
People wandering around with clipboards and safety vests don't necessarily belong there.

### The Sexy Stranger
If someone online seems too good to be true they just might be.
